Udemy Course Project- MySQL, Excel, PowerBi
This was a code-along primarily and for educational purposes.

This exercise was interesting, 
- Seeing what Excel can do with it's visualizations.
- MySQL using JOINS, CTE's and WINDOW FUNCTIONS to get to the results we want.
- Power BI Dashboard visualizing our data

Excel datasheet with Sales data from Course, already pre-cleaned.

Ran various SQL queries to get varying results of data we can find in the Sales Data.
Exported the results of these queries back into the workbook and created charts and pivot tables to vizualize the data.
Used Power BI to create a dashboard to visualize our findings.
